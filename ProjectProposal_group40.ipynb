    "   This topic is of interest to our group because, as female students preparing to enter the workforce, particularly in male dominated STEM fields, we have noticed the increased attention on the disparity between male and female workers throughout industries, and factors that contribute to this gap. We wanted to learn more about the components that affect a woman’s success in a specific field in order to be able to predict the industries that are the most profitable for women today. \n",
    " \n",
    "   There has been research done on different aspects of female employment, such as income, paid and unpaid leave, socioeconomic status, and education. With regards to COGS 108 in particular, there is a project focusing on the effect of maternity leave on female involvement in the workforce, which takes into consideration aspects of our research question (1). The results of this project conclude that there was a stronger effect of maternity leave on female participation in the workforce than participation on maternity leave. Another project describes policies surrounding acceptance rates of women in STEM careers and whether or not these policies are fair (2). This project shows that there is not much of an inequality between hiring rates of men and women in STEM fields, and that the proportion of men and women working in these fields is fairly equal. Both these projects use data that could be useful to answering our research question. \n",
